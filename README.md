# CMPE-255-Apache-Beam-Data-Engineering

This repository contains solutions to a three-part Data Engineering assignment focused on data exploration, automated analysis, and Apache Beam for data processing. Each assignment is organized into its own directory for clarity.

## Project Details

### Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with D3.js
- **Overview**: In this task, we conduct a detailed EDA on a complex Kaggle dataset, creating visually rich and interactive D3.js visualizations to provide insightful data stories and trends.
- **Files**: The `EDA_D3_notebook.ipynb` notebook includes all steps for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using advanced D3.js techniques.

### Assignment 2: Automated EDA with a Preferred Tool
- **Overview**: Here, automated EDA is applied to a different dataset, leveraging a popular tool (e.g., Sweetviz, Pandas Profiling) for generating a quick and visually appealing summary of the data.

### Assignment 3: Apache Beam Feature Demonstration
- **Overview**: This task showcases core Apache Beam concepts including composite transforms, windowing, triggers, and streaming. Using the BeamML library, we integrate ML workflows, demonstrating the frameworkâ€™s flexibility and scalability.

## Video Walkthrough
A video overview of each assignment provides a walkthrough of the main steps, design decisions, and final outcomes for each task.
